# Forms:

- Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form,which lives inside a <form> element
- Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
- Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.
- HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms .
